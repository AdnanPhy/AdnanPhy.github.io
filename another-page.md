```Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky``` ( November 11, 1821-February 9, 1881).  The sibling in The Brothers Karamazov who I like the most is Dmitri Fyodorovich Karamazov.

> “Beauty! I can't bear the thought that man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's still more awful is that man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with the ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth and innocence.”
